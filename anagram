#This method checks whether two strings are anagrams or not.
#An anagram is a word or term obtained by rearranging the letters of another word or term,
#and usually the letters of the original word are used exactly once:


from collections import Counter

def anagram(first, second):
    return Counter(first) == Counter(second)
anagram("abcd3", "3acdb") # True
